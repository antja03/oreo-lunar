# oreo-lunar
Garbage and heavily pasted attempt at modifying the reach constant on Lunar (AC on) using a sigscan-esk method. Made this before I took the time to learn how the JVM actually allocates constants so a lot of it doesn't really make much sense but hey, it worked (sometimes). Also comes with a dope auto clicker and a kernelmode r/w driver. It was the first driver I wrote so don't dog on me too hard lmao.
